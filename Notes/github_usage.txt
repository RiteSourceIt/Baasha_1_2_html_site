git hub references
==================
If you create a new Git repository ..


git clone   https://.... *.git

git checkout  -b "New branch"  will create a new branch.

git add .      ( see there I a  DOT )
will add  all the files that are changed.

git commit -m "comments.."  will commit changes

git push   
this will push files to remote repository.


if someone else created a branch to your repository you can get it like

git fetch

this will get all the branches to your current directory.

git checkout  branchname   will switch to new brach.

if you want to know current working branch ,

git branch

will list all branches and current one will have * (star)

Now once your changes are committed to a branch and ready to be merged with branch you started , you can
send a pull requrest.  I usually do this online.

I also merge online after verifying the changes.


Now think how you will use git hub

a)  A remote place to back up your code.

b)  push changes you make to remote place every time it is good to go

c)  When you are working with multiple team members, on different functionality you can create branches and work.


work on branch, send pull request merge with original.
